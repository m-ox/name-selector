/*
Random Person Selector:
 Using HTML, CSS, and JS, build a UI that allows a user to randomly choose from a list of people
   - Must render names from the list on screen
   - Must be weighted and have an easy way to add / subtract weight
   - Can't choose the same person twice in a row
   - Randomly chosen should be rendered on the screen
 - Try adding some animations (maybe a shuffle) for fun!
